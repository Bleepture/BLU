# BLU
Is a spectrum analyzer on JSFX which develops the ideas of Cockos and Saike. Features: mid-side mode, +6 dB/oct slope (Brown noise), graphics with a focus on design and minimalism. The main feature is that the volume scale follows the slope of the spectrum, which is logical and more informative than the standard grid, especially in the low-frequency range.
